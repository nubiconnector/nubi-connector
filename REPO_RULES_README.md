## Repository Rules

#### GIT rules

-   ! Branches should be named related to task/bug context, e.g `bugifx/NU-num` or `feature/NU-num`.
-   ! Currently we have two branches: `dev` and `master`. `dev` branch should be a target branch for QA and `master` production one.
-   ! We should never do push to `master` branch directly.
-   ! Every implemented feature should have related pull request created and have at least two reviews in order to be merged to `master`.

### Component Rules

-   Component should have the same name as a component folder and then as a class name in order to not mess things.
